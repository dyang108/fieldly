# Mypy Integration

This document summarizes the improvements made to add static type checking with mypy to the project.

## Overall Improvements

1. Added comprehensive type annotations throughout the codebase
2. Created a central type definitions module (`type_definitions.py`)
3. Added mypy configuration (`mypy.ini`) with strict type checking
4. Created a helper script to run type checking (`scripts/mypy_check.py`)
5. Fixed implicit optionals and proper typing for critical functions
6. Added type stubs for third-party libraries

## Centralized Type Definitions

The `type_definitions.py` file provides common type definitions used across the codebase:

- `Provider` type for LLM providers (`'deepseek'`, `'openai'`, `'anthropic'`, `'ollama'`)
- `StorageType` for storage backends (`'local'`, `'s3'`)
- `StorageConfig` for storage configuration
- `FileInfo` for file metadata
- `ApiConfig` for API provider configuration
- `ProviderConfigs` for provider-specific configuration
- `SchemaDefinition` for schema structure

## Configuration Management

1. Centralized configuration in `config.py` with strong typing
2. Made `constants.py` an interface to `config.py` that maintains the same API but delegates to the config singleton
3. Removed redundant environment variable loading
4. Properly typed configuration values

## Storage Implementations

1. Enhanced `StorageInterface` with proper return types
2. Created a `Storage` protocol class for better typing
3. Added proper type annotations to `LocalStorage` and `S3Storage`
4. Added missing `read_file` method implementation

## Database Models

1. Added proper type annotations to SQLAlchemy models
2. Improved typing for relationships between models
3. Added more precise typing for session handling

## Remaining Issues

There are still several typing issues to fix:

1. SQLAlchemy typing needs more work (Column types vs. Python types)
2. Some APIs need to be updated for proper type checking
3. Need to install more type stubs for third-party libraries
4. Flask route handlers need proper return type annotations

## How to Run Type Checking

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install mypy types-requests
```

Run the mypy check script:

```bash
python scripts/mypy_check.py
```
